# SDR Analytics POC

Frontend proof-of-concept for the SDR Analytics dashboard. The project is built with React, Vite, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Chart.js.

## Getting Started

Install dependencies and start the development server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

The app provides a responsive dashboard shell with a sticky header and a sample Chart.js line chart to validate the visualization stack.
