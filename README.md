# SDR Analytics POC

Frontend proof-of-concept for the SDR Analytics dashboard. The project is built with React, Vite, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Chart.js.

## Quick Start

Spin up the local environment in a single command:

```bash
npm i && npm run dev
```

This installs dependencies and launches the Vite dev server. Open the printed URL in your browser to explore the dashboard.

## Demo Flow (under 2 minutes)

1. **Reseed data** – use the reseed control to refresh the dataset so the audience sees how fast the dashboard resets.
2. **Apply filters** – demonstrate filtering by team, segment, or owner to highlight drill-down capabilities.
3. **Compare weeks** – toggle the week-over-week comparison to show trend analysis.
4. **Show “Top Windows”** – navigate to the Top Windows view to point out peak booking opportunities.
5. **Show “Untapped”** – surface the Untapped accounts list to discuss new outreach targets.
6. **Check No-Show** – review the No-Show metrics to cover meeting quality.
7. **End on Pipeline Health** – wrap up with the Pipeline Health summary to reinforce overall performance.

The sequence provides a fast, end-to-end narrative for showcasing the dashboard’s most important insights.
